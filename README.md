# ptsd (PaintTool Sai Downloader)

This project is a quick and dirty script to download PaintTool Sai, and then fetch updates when they come out. It's mostly targeting version 2 (64-bit), but I may extend it to version 1 and the 32-bit binary as well.

At present, it will expect to do everything it its own directory, but I'm looking at adding a configuration file or some such for ease of use later.

You will still need to purchase and apply your own license files, that's outside the scope of this project.
