# ptsd (PaintTool Sai Downloader)

This project is a quick and dirty script to download PaintTool Sai, and then fetch updates when they come out. It's mostly targeting version 2 (64-bit), but I may extend it to version 1 and the 32-bit binary as well.

At present, it will expect to do everything it its own directory, but I'm looking at adding a configuration file or some such for ease of use later.

You will still need to purchase and apply your own license files, that's outside the scope of this project.

Currently, you run the "run_me.bat" file in order to launch the Powershell file that does the work. Why? Because I couldn't figure out a pretty universal way to write this in prue batch file.
I will try and write up instructions on how to just run the Powershell file directly, but that involves mucking about with security settings, I don't love the idea of making anyone less secure if I can help it.
I may also someday try for a rewrite in some other language or some such that does a better job. We'll see.
